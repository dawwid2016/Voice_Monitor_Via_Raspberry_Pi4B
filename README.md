## Design intention
Many thoughts in life are generated by communication. This simple recording tool can help you record every sentence when the speed of paper and pen recording can't keep up with the operation of the brain.

## Innovation
In order to reduce the recording of non-target audio, the threshold is set on the volume, and the non-human voice is automatically cut off by the way of finding the maximum volume in blocks. **Through the marking system, all effective audio before and after the recording content is retained, making the content more coherent.**

## Timing
Time setting through parameter.

## Running code

  chmod +x ./monitor.sh
